# Frontend Development

## Overview
Frontend development involves building the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) of a website or web application. It focuses on what users interact with directly in their browsers. The three core technologies of frontend development are:

1. **HTML (HyperText Markup Language)** – The structure of a webpage.
2. **CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)** – The styling and layout of a webpage.
3. **JavaScript (JS)** – The behavior and interactivity of a webpage.

This repository contains a frontend project demonstrating best practices in modern web development.
